# IRL Trust -- dao lending pool that uses in-real-life trust between people to give credit

# Original post:
a micro-lending pool of people that personally know the borrower

This is an alternative to collateralized loans and mimics the credit-score system. From my experience in working in consumer banking and researching various models for financing, including microfinancing and anthropology, this is our society's best bet ðŸ™‚

Key ideas:
- lenders personally know the borrower(s). they are family and real-life friends
- lending pool is a dao
- dao chooses whom to accept as an additional lender (AL) based on the AL's relationship with other lenders and borrower(s)
- the loans are structured.
    - bi-weekly or monthly payments of a specific amount
    - downpayment
    - interest
    - limit on how much to take from the loan in a month
- dao approves addresses, where the borrower can spend the loan
- white-listed or token-gatedspending addresses for spending
- credit-score based on the connectivity in a graph and past history
- optional: dispute resolutions
- optional: annonymity
